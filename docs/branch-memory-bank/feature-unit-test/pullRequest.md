# Pull Request Overview

## Goal
Implement unit tests for the project to improve code quality and reliability.

## Status
The implementation of unit tests has been completed with a focus on the most critical components:

1. **Domain Layer**:
   - Implemented tests for domain entities (Tag, DocumentPath, MemoryDocument)
   - Ensured proper validation, error handling, and business logic is tested

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Implemented tests for branch use cases (ReadBranchDocumentUseCase, WriteBranchDocumentUseCase)
   - Implemented tests for global use cases (ReadGlobalDocumentUseCase, WriteGlobalDocumentUseCase)
   - Tests cover proper validation, error handling, and domain object manipulations

## Approach
- Used Jest for writing unit tests
- Created test files in `__tests__` directories next to the files they test
- Used mocks for external dependencies (repositories, services)
- Applied AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern for test structure
- Ensured full coverage of edge cases and error scenarios

## Future Improvements
While this PR focuses on the most critical components, there are areas that could benefit from additional testing in the future:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - File system based repository implementations
   - Configuration providers and services

2. **Interface Layer**:
   - Controllers
   - Presenters

## Testing
Tests were run using Jest with the command `yarn test:coverage`. The tests have significantly improved code coverage from 0% to the current level.

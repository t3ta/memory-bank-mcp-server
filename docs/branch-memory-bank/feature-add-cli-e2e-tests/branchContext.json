    "purpose": "Add end-to-end (E2E) tests for the Memory Bank CLI to ensure all commands function correctly in a real-world environment.",
    "userStory": {
      "problem": "Currently, there are no automated E2E tests for the CLI, making it difficult to verify that CLI commands work as expected across different environments and with various inputs.",
      "features": [
        "Create test infrastructure for CLI command execution",
        "Implement E2E tests for all CLI command groups",
        "Verify both happy paths and error handling",
        "Ensure reliable test execution in CI/CD pipelines"
      ],
      "expectedBehavior": "All CLI commands should be thoroughly tested to ensure they behave as expected with various inputs and in different scenarios."

    "goals": [
      "Create a robust test infrastructure for CLI command testing",
      "Implement comprehensive test coverage for all CLI commands",
      "Ensure tests run reliably in CI/CD environments",
      "Provide clear test output and helpful diagnostics"
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "Tests must be independent and not interfere with each other",
      "Tests should clean up after themselves to avoid side effects",
      "Test environments should mimic real-world usage as closely as possible"

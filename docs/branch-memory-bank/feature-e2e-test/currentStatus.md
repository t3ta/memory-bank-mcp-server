# Current Status Analysis

## Project Overview
Memory Bank MCP Server is a server implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), designed to manage project documentation and context across sessions. The current branch `feature/e2e-test` is focused on implementing end-to-end (E2E) tests for the server.

## Technical Issues
The main challenge is with CommonJS/ESM compatibility in the E2E test environment:

1. **Module Format Mismatch**: 
   - The MCP SDK uses ESM format
   - The test environment (Jest) works better with CommonJS
   - This causes import/require conflicts

2. **Test Communication Issues**:
   - Communication with the server process via JSON-RPC is unstable
   - Response parsing from stdout is inconsistent
   - Server process management needs improvement

3. **Configuration Status**:
   - `package.json` has been modified but still lacks proper CommonJS setup
   - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.test.json` have been updated for CommonJS
   - `jest.config.cjs` is configured but may need optimization

## Implementation Progress
1. **Test Infrastructure**: 
   - Basic server manager implementation complete
   - Client operations with JSON-RPC partially working
   - Test utilities for setup/teardown implemented

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Several test files created but not all are working
   - File system verification partially working
   - MCP protocol tests need debugging

## Identified Solutions

1. **Migration to CommonJS**:
   - Complete the migration from ESM to CommonJS
   - Update all import/export statements
   - Ensure proper module resolution

2. **Test Approach Refinement**:
   - Simplify the testing approach
   - Focus on file system verification
   - Improve server process management
   - Enhance isolation between tests

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Finalize Jest configuration
   - Update TypeScript settings
   - Ensure proper module resolution

## Next Steps

1. Complete the CommonJS migration following the plan in `docs/global-memory-bank/commonjs-migration-plan.md`
2. Fix and optimize the server-client communication in tests
3. Refine the test approach to focus on reliable verification methods
4. Implement working test cases for all MCP tools
5. Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup

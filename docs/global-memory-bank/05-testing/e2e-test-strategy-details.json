    "overview": "This comprehensive E2E testing strategy aims to validate the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the Memory Bank MCP Server. By orchestrating a series of automated tests against a live server instance, we'll simulate real-world usage patterns and verify that all components function harmoniously together.\n",
    "testing_principles": "1. **Isolation**: Each test should run in its own isolated environment\n2. **Reproducibility**: Tests must produce consistent results on repeated executions\n3. **Completeness**: All MCP tools and critical user flows must be covered\n4. **Error Validation**: Both happy path and error scenarios must be tested\n5. **Non-interference**: Tests should clean up after themselves, leaving no traces\n",
    "test_structure": [
      "The E2E test suite will be organized into four distinct phases, each building upon the foundation laid by the previous one:\nEstablish the foundational testing framework that provides:\nEnvironment setup and teardown\nServer process management\nClient connection abstractions\nTesting utilities for common operations\n**Key Files**:\n`tests/e2e/setup.ts`\n`tests/e2e/helpers/test-server.ts`\n`tests/e2e/helpers/mcp-client.ts`\n`tests/e2e/helpers/test-utils.ts`\nValidate the fundamental data storage and retrieval capabilities:\nTool enumeration\nBranch memory bank read/write operations\nGlobal memory bank read/write operations\n**Key Files**:\n`tests/e2e/tools/list-tools.test.ts`\n`tests/e2e/tools/branch-memory.test.ts`\n`tests/e2e/tools/global-memory.test.ts`\nVerify the system's ability to provide contextual information:\nRules retrieval in multiple languages\nRecent branch history tracking\nComprehensive context aggregation\n**Key Files**:\n`tests/e2e/tools/read-rules.test.ts`\n`tests/e2e/tools/recent-branches.test.ts`\n`tests/e2e/tools/read-context.test.ts`\nChallenge the system's resilience and error management:\nInvalid parameter handling\nNon-existent resource references\nConcurrent access patterns\n**Key Files**:",

    "success_criteria": "The E2E test implementation will be considered successful when:\n1. All MCP tools have comprehensive test coverage\n2. All tests pass consistently in CI environments\n3. Error scenarios are properly detected and handled\n4. Test documentation clearly explains the purpose and scope of each test\n5. Test suite execution time remains reasonable for CI/CD workflows\n",
    "implementation_timeline": "The implementation will proceed through the four phases sequentially, with each phase resulting in a separate PR:\n1. **Phase 1**: Test Infrastructure - Week 1\n2. **Phase 2**: Core Memory Operations - Week 2\n3. **Phase 3**: Metadata & Context Operations - Week 3\n4. **Phase 4**: Error Handling & Edge Cases - Week 4\n",

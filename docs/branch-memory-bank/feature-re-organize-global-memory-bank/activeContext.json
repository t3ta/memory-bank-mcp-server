Created a detailed implementation plan in `tag-reorganization-implementation-plan.json`\n4. Identified 10 logical tag categories to improve organization\n5. Planned consolidation of similar tags (e.g., merging version tags)"

Begin with directory restructuring as it is least disruptive to the system\n3. Apply a gradual approach to tag consolidation to maintain system stability\n4. Maintain both index files during transition for backward compatibility\n5. Focus on creating proper documentation for each category"

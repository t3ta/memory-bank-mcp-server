    "project_overview": "Memory Bank MCP Server is a server implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), designed to manage project documentation and context across sessions. The current branch `feature/e2e-test` is focused on implementing end-to-end (E2E) tests for the server.\n",
    "technical_issues": [
      "The main challenge is with CommonJS/ESM compatibility in the E2E test environment:\n1. **Module Format Mismatch**:\nThe MCP SDK uses ESM format\nThe test environment (Jest) works better with CommonJS\nThis causes import/require conflicts\n2. **Test Communication Issues**:\nCommunication with the server process via JSON-RPC is unstable\nResponse parsing from stdout is inconsistent\nServer process management needs improvement\n3. **Configuration Status**:",
      "`package.json` has been modified but still lacks proper CommonJS setup",
      "`tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.test.json` have been updated for CommonJS",
      "`jest.config.cjs` is configured but may need optimization"
    ],
    "implementation_progress": [
      "1. **Test Infrastructure**:\nBasic server manager implementation complete\nClient operations with JSON-RPC partially working\nTest utilities for setup/teardown implemented\n2. **Test Cases**:",
      "Several test files created but not all are working",
      "File system verification partially working",
      "MCP protocol tests need debugging"
    ],
    "identified_solutions": [
      "1. **Migration to CommonJS**:\nComplete the migration from ESM to CommonJS\nUpdate all import/export statements\nEnsure proper module resolution\n2. **Test Approach Refinement**:\nSimplify the testing approach\nFocus on file system verification\nImprove server process management\nEnhance isolation between tests\n3. **Configuration Updates**:",
      "Finalize Jest configuration",
      "Update TypeScript settings",
      "Ensure proper module resolution"
    ],
    "next_steps": "1. Complete the CommonJS migration following the plan in `docs/global-memory-bank/commonjs-migration-plan.md`\n2. Fix and optimize the server-client communication in tests\n3. Refine the test approach to focus on reliable verification methods\n4. Implement working test cases for all MCP tools\n5. Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup"
